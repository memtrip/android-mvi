### MVI Design pattern
A production ready Kotlin example of the Android MVI (model view intent) pattern, a render/layout mechanism is used to provide high unit test coverage throughout the reactive plumbing.

### How to navigate the code

- Get the big picture from the MVI pattern interfaces at the root of `com.consistence.pinyin`
